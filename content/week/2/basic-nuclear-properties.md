### Introduction

* The strong nuclear force is responsible for holding the nucleus together.
* Stable nuclei do not decay by the strong interaction. They may transform by beta and alpha emission (weak or electromagnetic) with long lifetimes.
* The binding energy is the energy required to split a nucleus into its constituents. It gives information on forces between nucleons, stability of the nucleus, and energy released or required in nuclear decays or reactions.
* The atomic nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. Protons carry one unit of positive charge (+e) and neutrons carry no charge. These particles are packed together into an extremely small space at the center of an atom.
* The number of protons in the nucleus is given by the atomic number, Z. The number of neutrons in the nucleus is the neutron number, N. The total number of nucleons is the mass number, A. These numbers are related by A = Z + N

## Size

size of an atom = $10^{-10}m$

size of a nucleus = $10^{-15}m$

It is evident from the α-particle scattering by Rutherford, that the nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons only. There is an experimental evidence that nuclear density ρ remains approximately constant over most of the nucleus volume and then decreases rapidly to  zero.

So, nuclear volume is approximately proportional to the number of nucleons *i.e.,* mass number $A$.

$$
V = \frac{4}{3}πR^3 \\\\
\implies \frac{4}{3}πR^3 \propto A \\\\
\implies R \propto A^\frac{1}{3} \\\\
\implies R = R_0A^\frac{1}{3}
$$
where $R_0$ is the nuclear unit radius and $R$ is the nuclear radius.

Thus we need to find the $R_0$ to get the nuclear radius. The study is divided into two.

1. Study based on the range of nuclear forces, the nucleus is probed by a nucleon or light nucleus
2. Study the electric field and charge distribution of the nucleus, the nucleus is probed by electron or muon.

## Binding Energy

Normally the mass of the atom should be the sum of masses of its constituents. For simplicity, we are neglecting the mass of electron and adding the mass of protons and neutrons to find the mass of the atom. But it's turn out that the atomic mass is less than its sum of its constiutents. This deficit is termed as *mass defect* or *mass deficiency*.

The nucleons are held together by **strong nuclear force** to form the stable nucleus. So inorder to seperate it we need to provide energy. It turns out the energy is equivalent to the deficieny in the mass of the atom. So some mass is converted to energy inorder to form the stable nucleus, and this energy is called the **Binding energy of the atom**

The mass defect $ΔM =$ sum of mass of all nucleons - orignal mass $= [Zm_p + Nm_n] - M_{nuclues}$

This mass deficit is infact the binding energy $E_B = ΔMc^2$

Now we need to find the Binding energy per nucleon for more use, $B = \frac{E_B}{A}$, where $A$ is the mass number, which is given by $A = Z +N$, where $Z$ is the number of protons and $N$ is the number of neutrons.  The binding energy for stable nuclei is always a positive number, as the nucleus must gain energy for the nucleons to move apart from each other.

The binding energy per nucleon ($\frac{B}{A}$) is defined as the average energy required to remove an individual nucleon from a nucleus. It is the average binding energy per nucleon that is used for the measure of the stability of the nucleus. The greater the binding energy per nucleon, the more stable the nucleus is.
